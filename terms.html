One Code may be used per transaction. Codes are void where prohibited by law. Codes are void if not obtained through authorized, legitimate channels, or if any part is defective, altered, duplicated, photocopied, forged, counterfeited, mutilated or tampered with in any way, or if Codes contain or are the result of a printing, seeding, typographical, mechanical or other error(s), or do not contain proper security devices (an “irregular Code”).  Any attempt to obtain or generate multiple Codes and/or irregular Codes and/or to use multiple names, email addresses, phone numbers and/or any fraudulent, illegal or other non-permissible mechanisms to obtain Codes, as determined by Live Nation in its sole discretion, shall give Live Nation the right to disqualify user. Codes have no cash value and cannot be exchanged for cash or credit, except as required by law. Codes cannot be sold or bought. Codes will be void if sold or transferred for compensation. A Code can be used only once and any unused value will be forfeited. Codes cannot be combined with other product offers or promotions. Codes cannot be used for past purchases or offers. Use of a Code for unauthorized advertising, marketing or other promotional purposes is strictly prohibited. Codes cannot be replaced if lost or stolen and Live Nation is not responsible for any damage or loss resulting from unauthorized use. Tickets purchased using a Code may be for personal use or gifts only, and are not valid for resale. If a Code is used in violation of these Terms of Use, Live Nation reserves the right to (a) cancel any ticket order, or (b) charge user’s credit card for value of tickets after shipment. Once tickets are issued, they cannot be exchanged for other tickets or merchandise.
